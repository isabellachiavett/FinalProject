      <h2>
        I wrote this in January. I believe it still holds strong in representing
        who I am.
      </h2>
      <p class="aboutme">
        who am i? well my friends call me “Isabella”; my family only refer to me
        as “Nena” my boyfriend has the privilege of “amor” and while that is
        “who I am” it only captivates my flesh and blood; not the soul behind it
        all
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        isabella chiavettone: a hardworking; college graduate at only twenty
        years old!!! i can hear my moms voice as i write this knowing that is
        how she sees me i am grateful that those who love me see me that way
        knowing there was a point where i held resentment towards those who
        placed expectations on me and while i still hold myself to certain
        expectations i know that i; and everyone else around me, is doing the
        best with what we have got
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        that’s what life is, isn’t it? a contradiction often comprised of the
        battle between “who i am” and “what i want to be” college right! a time
        where i am supposed to figure out my future career i still don’t know
        what i want to do and i’m still working at the same coffee shop since i
        was 16
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        that is all who i could be, what i could believe but i wake up every day
        knowing that i am apart of a reality much bigger my actions affect not
        only me, but my community; my planet in my personal pursuit of pleasure
        i found serving others truly fulfills me
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        if 16 year old isabella were to read this she would be underwhelmed with
        who she became thank goodness for maturing! (okay this was pretty
        extreme 16 y.o. me wasn’t that blind with privilege)
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        so isabella chiavettone; who i really am: i am a spiritual; dependable;
        supportive; loving; authentic individual i am working towards feeding my
        soul and most importantly; i am doing my best with what i got
      </p>
